summary: "Why autonomy matters to me and how it shapes engagements."
---

I traded full-time roles for the focus and freedom of contracting.

## The upside
- I pick engagements where I can move the needle fast.
- I design lean delivery loops: short specs, demos, ship.
- I keep one calendar: work, learning, rest.

## The hard parts
- Pipeline discipline matters more than any framework.
- Saying **no** is the most profitable tool I have.
- Some weeks are feast, some are famine; systems steady the curve.

## What clients notice
Clear comms, outcomes over output, and that I show the work transparently.

If you care about momentum and clear ownership, we're likely a fit.
