I start every kickoff with: **"What changes if this project succeeds?"**

## Why this works
- It surfaces the real constraint: revenue, churn, trust, time, or risk.
- It turns vague asks into measurable outcomes.
- It reveals stakeholders I should meet early.

## How I use the answer
I map a thin-slice release that proves movement on that outcome.
I propose metrics we can check weekly.
I keep scope honest when new ideas appear.

When we anchor on impact, we ship calmer and faster.
